## Milestone 2: Object Creation
This document outlines the process of creating a custom object in Salesforce named Customer Info, which is designed to store and manage customer-related data. The object includes support for reporting, search, and field history tracking to enhance visibility and usability across the platform.

To begin, navigate to the Setup area in Salesforce by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner. From there, select Object Manager. Once inside the Object Manager, click on Create and choose Custom Object to initiate the creation process.

In the custom object setup form, enter the Label Name as Customer Info and the Plural Label as Customers Info. For the Record Name, specify Customer Name and set the Data Type to Text.

Make sure to enable the following options: Allow Reports, Allow Search, and Track Field History. These settings will ensure that the object can be included in reports, easily searched, and audited for field-level changes over time.

Once all required information is filled out and the appropriate settings are selected, click Save and New to complete the creation of the object and proceed with defining additional fields or related objects.

This setup creates a robust foundation for managing customer information within a custom Salesforce data model.
